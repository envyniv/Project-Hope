#######STAGE PREREQUISITES

A stage must have:
    * StaticBody2D with Sprite and Collision[Shape/Polygon]
    * CameraLimits instanced scene
    * PlayerSpawn instanced scene
    * Hidden Label node whose text is the name of the stage and that has been renamed to "Stage_Name"
ALL UNDER A RENAMED "Scene" Node which is actually just a basic Node(NOT NODE2D)

The Structure must, then, be as follows:

"Stage" Node
|
└──"Stage_Name" Label with Name as text (Not visible)
|
└──StaticBody2D
|       |
|       └──Sprite
|       |
|       └──Collision[Shape/Polygon]
|
└──CameraLimits (tick editable children)
|
└──PlayerSpawn (tick editable children)
