#######STAGE PREREQUISITES

A stage must have:
    * StaticBody2D with Sprite and Collision[Shape/Polygon]
    * CameraLimits instanced scene
    * PlayerSpawn instanced scene
ALL UNDER A Node (not Node2D) that has been renamed to "Stage" (without Quotations)

The Structure must, then, be as follows:
