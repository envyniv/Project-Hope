Estimated Completion Percentage:
![Pretty Much Nothing](https://progress-bar.dev/11?title=Overhauling%20Systems)

<details><summary>Entities</summary>

## Entities
  - [X] PlayerFollower -> PartyMember
  - [ ] Earthbound-like snake movement
  - [ ] _Parties_, Allow leader switch
  - [X] _Party -> AwareBase_:
  Instead of Party managing everything for the Player, make entities manage their own party, allowing for extra flexibility
  - [X] _FileMan's party funcs -> AwareBase_:
  Since entities now manage their parties, having the old functions makes little sense
  - [ ] _FileMan's item funcs -> AwareBase_?
  Should entities have their own inventories?
  - [ ] Stacking
    - [ ] Hide when colliding with `following`, show when not
    - [ ] Destroy when stacked
    - [ ] _NPC_, Stacking when joining party
  - [x] _Party members_, fix jittering
        ([related to normalized vectors](https://youtu.be/fZ6bOERw03M?t=123))
  - [x] _Party members_, fix always playing walk anim
  - [x] replace `snakeTail` & `follower` with a proper system
  - [ ] _NPC_, follow path node
  - [X] _NPC_, Remove "party dialog" property and "joins party" check.
  These things should be handled in dialogue scripts
  - [ ] Make proper use of state machines
  - [X] _AwareBase -> VesselBase_, _Lifeform -> Soul_

## Minor tweaks
  - [x] _Player_, fix bad animation names
  - [x] _NPC_, conditionally expose properties
  - [x] _Player_, Change Sprinting to Slingshot Running
  - [X] _Camera_, borrowing system:
  Instead of following only one entity, the camera will now remember every previous target, so that if its current target is deleted, the camera will being following the previous target, this should help avoiding hard crashes and add more flexibility
  - [X] _CameraLimits_, move to ReferenceRect

## Lifeforms
- [ ] use `_get_property_list()` instead of `export` for type safety when using the editor
  
</details>

<details><summary>Dialogue Box</summary>

</details>

<details><summary>Saving and Loading</summary>

  - [x] move to Godot Resource
  - [x] add previews
  - [x] allow for more than 3 saves
  - [x] fix Deleting save not giving focus back to plus button
  - [ ] _Save Slot Menu_, fix copy functionality
  - [X] _SaveFile_, remove party members?
  Since whole scene is saved, we can just use the party variable present in the Player entity. If not removing, use for save file sanitation.
  - [X] _SaveFile_, remove position and lead?
  Once again, since the whole current scene is saved, there really is no need for these to be in the save.

  - [ ] _ScnChgTrigger_, make it inherit from Interactable
    - [ ] _Interactable_, make it inherit from Area2D
  - [ ] fix custom classes not working properly / being seen as invalid hints;
