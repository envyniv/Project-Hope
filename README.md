# Project Hope
My take on a 2D [Mother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_(video_game_series))-like ARPG in the style of a [Capcom-like fighting game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter) with some [WarioWare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wario_(series)#WarioWare_series) sprinkled on top.

Coded in Godot(https://godotengine.org/).

# Troubleshooting

Q: My pc is fairly old and won't run the game, despite its minimum requirements.

A: Go [here](https://fdossena.com/?p=mesa/index.frag), download the proper version you need and put it in the same folder as Godot (if you're editing the project) or as the game itself.
