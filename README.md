# Project Hope
My take on a 2D [Mother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_(video_game_series))-like ARPG in the style of a [Capcom-like fighting game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter) with some [WarioWare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wario_(series)#WarioWare_series) sprinkled on top.

###### QnA (Not Applicable Yet)

**Q1: My pc is fairly old and won't run the game**

A: Go [here](https://fdossena.com/?p=mesa/index.frag), download the proper version you need and put it in the same folder as Godot (if you're editing the project) or as the game itself.

**Q1.1: I did that, yet it's still not working.**

A: Make a folder with the same name as the exe of the program you want to run followed by .local. For instance, hope.exe.local, Inside this folder, copy opengl32.dll from Mesa and run the program.

**Q1.2: why doesn't this work???????**

A: If you're on Windows 7/8, Simply drag the exe of the program you want to run (could be Godot or The Game Itself) on MesaInjector.
