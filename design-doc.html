<h1 style="">ABOUT THE WORLD</h1>
<h6>The cities are connected by lore in a “triangular” way.</h6>
<h3>Prima Luna</h3> Italian city in which there is never the day, there is only night.

<h3>Stargaze</h3> Italo-American city where you can only see stars in the sky doesn't matter if it's day or night.
Sub-city of Prima Luna born in the 20th July 1969, extremely famous for its free lunar trips

<h3>Blancodom</h3> City founded by travellers and aristocrats in the 1900s, the inhabitants still wear classic aristocrat clothing: blue jacket and a white wig.

<h3>Oniryc</h3> Rebuilt Utopia after the 1962 earthquake

<h3>Fantasia</h3> (pronounced /fan·tà·ṣi·a/, not /fan·ta·ṣì·a/) City famous for its inventors.

Utopia: Ancient city of travellers coming from various parts of the world. Historians believe it was founded at the start of humanity itself.

<h3>Unlucky Aperod</h3>: now-abandoned city founded by the cowboy named John in the 1856s.

<h3>Lucky Land</h3> this, now-abandoned, city was founded by Messin Lak's brother, nicknamed “Handful o’luck”, around the same timeframe as Unlucky Aperod was. This place was known all around Evrys as “The Luckiest Place Ever”, however documentation that would explain the meaning behind this title, to this day, is still missing;
Lots of the families that originally lived here were (after a catastrophe, which documentation about, is again, still missing to this day), subsequently moved to Ace

<h3>Ace</h3> Casino-city founded by Big Man’s ancestor, also known by the name “Biggest Lad”

<h3>Sharplains</h3> city founded by “the Prince” in 1834. The peculiar name comes from the unique pyramidal rock formation that happens to be common there; divided in 4 sections.
<h4>Civil Zone I</h4>
On sea level, most of the shops in Sharplains reside here.
<h4>Civil Zone II</h4>
Above sea level,on a hill, decorated with trees and bushes.
<h4>Civil Zone III</h4>
located on a mountain, surrounded by a forest. Most of the houses there are built out of wood

<h3>Nay ve</h3> City founded by pirates, flooded like Venice. Known for the Excellent Food.

<h3>Dessert Hills</h3> Community founded by “the Prince” sometime after Sharplains. Not a real city, more like a camping spot.

<h3>Phiuturr</h3> community founded by the ancient Greek population around 480 BCE, original spelling seems to be “Φυτυρ”

<h3>Warpwave</h3> Almost nothing is currently known about this little island, except there being an extremely powerful source of energy coming from it.
Scientists and Physicists from all Evrys are studying said source of energy and some applications for it.

<h3>Gates of Hae’ven</h3>

<h1 style="">ABOUT THE EVENTS</h1>

<h6>This story is happening on a fictional island named “Evrys”, in the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Triangle">Bermuda Triangle</a>”, also known as the “Devil's Triangle/Palm” or “Hurricane Alley”. It's Inspired on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Island">Phillip Island.</a></h6>

<h2 style="">Chapter 1 - Start</h2>
<pre>

</pre>
<h2 style="">Chapter 2 - Let's Begin</h2>
<pre>
Kevin and Quinton get to know each other; and Quinton tours Kevin around Ellyssic, they get to the plaza, in the middle of the plaza there’s a statue, while Quinton is telling the ancient origins of the statue to kevin, suddenly, an Earthquake happens, after it calms down, the statue starts moving and pushes a citizen away (fucking kakyoins him into the nearest building), Kevin gets hit with the statue’s scepter, and gets teleported to aa weird place, in which there is a series of corridors and rooms with weird decorations (distorted, scrapped game assets), kevin then reaches a door, walks into it, and returns to the normal world. The statue then walks back into its original position.

as by tradition, everybody attends the yearly festival in Sharplains.
but, this time, right as the fireworks are about to start, the alert system triggers:
"ALERT, ALERT, FIRE IN CIVIL ZONE 3"
and as everyone hears it going off, a bunch of people come running to the left side, screaming in terror.
Quinton and Kevin and a couple others instead, run towards Civil Zone III.
There, they meet a group of people trying to tame the flames and another group that's trying to take down the beast that caused this fire.
There, you meet Charlie, a kid who residedes there, whom, with his will to protect his family, will help you defeat the beast.
</pre>
<h2 style="">Chapter 3 - Behind The Mask (Previously "The Five Tapes")</h2>
<pre>
The party finds blueprints detailing the mechanism of a machine named "The Ultimate Purge" It functions by switching the *SUN's state: from SUN to RED_GIANT to PLANETARYNEBULA to NOVA to SUPERNOVA TO IPERNOVA. They also find one of the tapes which detail Phi's past.
Phi is revealed to have been an engineer, with advanced theoretical knowledge of the universe around him, but no practical experience. (this tape is pretty much his résumé to work at the E.S.P. [<b>Evrys' Space Project</b>])

</pre>
<h2 style="">Chapter 4 - Lamp-o’lution</h2>
<pre>
After finding proof of Phi’s plans, the party returns to Utopia, there, they are discussing what to do, and get news about a bunch of lamp shops opening in all cities and communities, even Dessert Hills and Phiuturr. They eventually end up meeting this mafia boss, named “Big Man”, who happens to be the owner of all these lamp shops, who he thinks might serve as the only light source when , according to Phi’s plan, the sun explodes. Big Man refuses to fight, instead, he challenges the player to a game of poker. the player defeats him and Kevin orders him to stop building the lamp shops, he says that while he is indeed the boss and the one wh
o ordered mass construction, he has no power over if they’re getting built or not, then sends the party to Borkia.
</pre>
<h2 style="">Chapter 5 - Borkia & Co. Ltd.</h2>
<pre>
The party finds Borkia, right as he and his men (which also happen to be Rugby Players) are exercising, they tell him to stop, Borkia rants, battle starts, Borkia’s men’s attack is just tackling the party, just like real rugby players
</pre>
<h2 style="">Chapter 6 - Burnt Soil (Previously "Holocaust")</h2>
<pre>
Last Boss Fight: 3 phases; normal Phi, Buff Phi, and robot Buff Phi.
Last Cutscene: people turn towards north. 4 cutscenes of people turning. Then, panoramic shot at a theatre. Then there’s the final boss battle. Kevin, Bella and Charlie are predetermined to shatter, while Quinton does resist until the end of the 3rd phase, due to his high defense stat. Even after all the struggles, the player is predestined to lose in the 3rd phase, and after being sent back to the menu, the only available button is “Bring it On!”, after clicking, the player will witness a cutscene in which all past villainsget together and walk up to the theater, bringing back Kevin, Bella and Charlie.
After defeating Phi everything goes back to normal and, after a long day, the party go into their respective homes and sleep.
[CUTSCENE]
it's the next day. everyone wakes up and decide to meet up.
They use Warpwave to get to Siberia.
*New World plays*
fade to black.
Suddenly, 3D versions of The Party appear.
like figurines, they get knocked to the ground by a hand.
Show 2d sprites of the party KO in the snow.
Kevin wakes up.
Like in the Beginning, he looks out of the window, to see the sun twitching.
He gets called by his mother, and he gets out of the room.
[CUTSCENE END]
The Player is then left in confusion.
What happens is: The team's Code stops working after the end of the game, they then become like figurines for a little amount of time, unable to move.
The Game Resets.
</pre>
<b>A new game has started.</b>

<h1>ABOUT THE GAMEPLAY MECHANICS</h1>

<h2>Dealing Damage</h2>
When attacking, a damage object will be created to deal damage and knockback upon impact with the “lifeform” object.
Said damage will be determined through an algorithm:
a variable named “choosedmg” is created to output a whole number between a set range (from 0 to n, which is this case is 100).
the game will then check if that whole number is more/or less than 0/25, 25/85, 85/100.
if it is in the 0/25 range, the damage object will deal to the enemy, upon impact, a random amount of damage between 1 and 4
otherwise, if it is in the 25/85 range, the damage object will deal to the enemy, upon impact, a random amount of damage between 5 and 8
or else if it is in the 85/100 range, the damage object will deal to the enemy, upon impact, a random amount of damage between 18 and 25
<h2>Attacking</h2>
When attacking the first 2 times, the player will move slightly towards the direction they’re facing when attacking.
The 3rd attack, instead, after giving a major boost of velocity towards the direction they’re facing, will let the player move freely, in exchange for speed. (e.g. spd=3)
Below: concept visualized.
<h2>Card Boost</h2>
When dealing damage to enemies the “K” factor bar will fill itself;
then, when the bar is full, combo mode is triggered.
Said mode should last 5 seconds, damage is 1.75x, slight speed boost (1.3x)
The party shares the same “K Factor” Bar
<h2>Defending/Reflecting</h2>
If one were to press the attack button while the enemy is attacking them, they’d be parrying the attack. When parrying, the player is dealt by the system ¼ the damage, while the enemy gets 4x the damage they’d have dealt on the player.
When parrying, a shader will be applied, layering some sort of shining fx on top of the player sprite/a surface will be created to layer shining fx on top of the player sprite, to then be destroyed after its intended purpose is over.
<h2>Music Make You Lose Control</h2>
When in a battle, during certain time frames of the song that’s playing in the background, party members will get a slight boost, dealing 1.25x the damage; while on the background will be layered the same aforementioned moving light blue background but with a “wavy” effect (through shaders maybe?), to give a “feeling of the world around you warping”.
<h6>example song: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lasthopeost/orchestrating-a-fight">Orchestrating a Fight</a></h6>
time frames: 0:26-0:56;
<h2>Minigames</h2>
When in a battle, “a variable named choosedmg is created to output a whole number between a set range (from 0 to n, which is this case is 100). the game will then check if said whole number is in the 85/100 range, the damage object will deal to the enemy, upon impact, a random amount of damage between 18 and 25” apart from all that, additional damage can be dealt to the enemy, because, when “choosedmg” is >85 and <100, when attacking, the player will be able to play a sort-of minigame, which will decide how much additional damage they’ll be able to deal.
if the player fails at executing successfully the objective of the minigame, they will deal no additional damage at all, if they do, however, successfully acquire the objective, they will deal up to 2.5x the original damage (min = 45; max = 63 [62.5])
<h2>Team Attack (may be scrapped)</h2>
When combo mode is activated, Party members, (except for the player, duh), will automatically execute team attacks, example:
Quinton throws a electrically-charged baseball and Charlie hits it, launching it towards the enemy, hitting the enemy will result in 15% The enemy’s current health to be dealt as damage.
If the player were to interfere with the team attack, the damage will instead amount to 25% of the enemy’s current health
<h2>Transitions</h2>
battle transition: when colliding with an enemy, apply a shader that’s a mixture of twisting, pixelization and chromatic aberration.

<h2>Threat Level and Reaction Behavior</h2>

<h1>THOUGHTS LOGS</h1>
<h6>
this is a collection of various thoughts or research of mine during the game's development cycle.
these will, most likely, **not** be in order

PROBLEM: i need fonts
possible solutions: use BitmapFont or DynamicFont.
BitmapFont can't:
- change its size or spacing
How would i achieve BitmapFonts?
Make fonts in FontForge, export as ttf and use fontbm to generate .fnt file.
that can then be used in Godot.
THOUGHTS://///////////////////////
just use DynamicFont, man. It's easier and way more convenient.

P.S.: OTF is superior.
P.P.S.: I need to convert some of my fonts from PNG to OTF

(one of) The OG plans for LAST HOPE was to be based around greek mythology.
As of now (due to being influenced by the PERSONA games, i guess?)
my ideas seem to be fit more for a PERSONA3: part II or something.
And while i think that's really cool, I don't want that.
So, you know what, we're going back to Greek Mythology.
Phi's name will probably be changed in the process, too.
Now, about the tarots, they're really cool but don't fit greek mythology;
so, i'll probably have to come up with my own things.
